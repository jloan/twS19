Taking the tutorial for e235.

This quarter, I am asking my tech writing students to use GitHub to manage a research log file. Not sure how this experiment will go. I sense is that GitHub is probably too robust a tool for the needs of simply managing a document; however, I like that it has the potential to be a project hosting platform for the course.
